# hcde-410-final
The goal of this project is to determine which factors are the most important or the dominant contributors to a player getting drafted. This will allow us to see whether there are qualities beyond the physical that weigh in during the draft picks.

Upon research that has been done, it has been shown that there is roughly a 0.03% chance for a player to get drafted into the NBA. These are low odds. With this research project I want to see what factor weighs in the most in a player getting drafted and if there are any confounding factors that can explain the draft picks as well. The research question that I came up with is "What is the greatest contributing factoring in a player getting drafted into the NBA?" While my hypothesis being "Players who score the most average points have the highest likelihood of getting drafted into the NBA." The research will be mostly based on physical characteristics of the players and that data is provided as a csv file to be analyzed. The program processing the data will be either Python, Google Sheets, Tableau, or a combination of the three.
