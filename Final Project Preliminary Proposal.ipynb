    "My motivation for this analysis is to understand what factor contributes the most for a player to be drafted into the NBA. I am interested in this analysis because I have a friend that may potentially go into the draft and I want to increase his chances by this research. It's also interesting from a human-centered perspective because it may shed light on possible discrimination for players that have the potential on paper, but do not get drafted because of superficial factors. The most prominent example I can give is Jeremy Lin who was not drafted when he was an NBA-caliber player coming out of Harvard on paper. Something that I hope to learn is what general managers and coaches value in a player, whether it's beyond the physical. I want talented players who deserve a fair shot at the league to shine like the rest, perhaps this research could motivate the league to look beyond how they assess future success. Much of the promises in new drafts don't end up to be the next Michael Jordan or Lebron James. There could be a more accurate way to determine future success in these players.\n",

This dataset is suitable for the research goal that I am addressing because it includes which draft pick the players were if they were drafted.

    "According to studies done around the NBA draft, an average player has a 1 in 3333 chance of making it to the NBA or a 0.03% chance. This is because basketball is constantly evolving and the next generation has more access to better training as well as coaching. Around 16,000 high schoolers will go on to play basketball at the collegiate level and only 110 will go on to play at least one game in the NBA. Getting into the NBA is no simply walk in the park. Considering that only 60 players are drafted into the NBA, two players for each team, determining the most important factor for success is crucial. One of the most obvious finding tends to be height and weight. The average height in the NBA is around 6ft 6in and a weight of around 220lbs. Now, depending on the position you play, this will drastically vary. However, no matter what position you play, you're going to have to play against these players, which is why it is logical to believe that physical stature is a good assessor. \n",

    "After reading the article from the link above, I think the overall decision to perform this study motivates me more to look closer at physical attributes as well as player statistics. The research question I chose still seems to be valid and my hypothesis will still have to be put to the test, but in terms of how I'll analyze the data and design my study, it should remain relatively grounded. The data I'll be analyzing will be the csv file will every college player that gave a run at the NBA draft and I plan to organize the data by each category in relation to draft pick numbers.\n",

    "The analytical method I'll use to answer my questions will most likely be a trend line of least squares regression method. What I plan to do is create a plot graph with the draft pick numbers as the y-axis and one main factor such as height as the axis and see the trend with a regression line. I will repeat this for every category that the csv file contains for every year of the draft data. Once I have the trend or regression lines, I will then compare them to each other and analyze which factor had the most impact in order, the steepest most likely meaning a stronger trend.\n",

    "In presenting my findings, I think I would show the trend of each year's data and perhaps even combine the graphs into one major graph color-coded differently to view the findings. Alternatively, I could do a spider-map where each factor for every year could be shown with a more clear visual display for the audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were to conduct this research in to more detailed steps, I would need to download every year's draft data beginning from 2012 to 2016. There is a file that contains all five draft data into one csv file, but I think analyzing each year will show a greater breadth of patterns for draft factors. Next, I would process each file using either Python and python data structure libraries such as pandas or numpy to generate graphs for each or go more of a graphical user interface route of importing the csv files into Google Sheets/Tableau and generating graphs that way. Moving onto generating the graphs, I'm thinking that a plot graph will be the most useful because I want to look for a trend in the data if there is one. Once, I have the trendlines for each category, I wand to analyze them by their slope and rank their correlation to draft picks. It may make more sense to just generate a spider graph with all of the categories as its legs and see the correlation that way, and that is something that may be more useful for the audience to see in the final presentation.
