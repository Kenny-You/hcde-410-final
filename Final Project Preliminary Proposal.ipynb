    "My motivation for this analysis is to understand what factor contributes the most for a player to be drafted into the NBA. I am interested in this analysis because I have a friend that may potentially go into the draft and I want to increase his chances by this research. It's also interesting from a human-centered perspective because it may shed light on possible discrimination for players that have the potential on paper, but do not get drafted because of superficial factors. The most prominent example I can give is Jeremy Lin who was not drafted when he was an NBA-caliber player coming out of Harvard on paper. Something that I hope to learn is what general managers and coaches value in a player, whether it's beyond the physical. I want talented players who deserve a fair shot at the league to shine like the rest, perhaps this research could motivate the league to look beyond how they assess future success. Much of the promises in new drafts don't end up to be the next Michael Jordan or Lebron James. There could be a more accurate way to determine future success in these players."

    "I plan to use the dataset of all the NBA draft combine measurements, beginning in 2012. The link to the dataset is https://data.world/achou/nba-draft-combine-measurements. The dataset is free to use for the public, no specific licensing is provided. This dataset is suitable for the research goal that I am addressing because it includes which draft pick the players were if they were drafted. Both players that did and did not get drafted are included in the dataset and that will give us a good contrast to see what the determining factor is between the two. In terms of ethical considerations, the data is for public viewing and not meant to be hidden from anyone as to provide transparency."
